So how does I get started with vLLM?

- Source: [github.com/vllm-project/vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) <br>

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm
  cd vllm
  # let's get to work
  ```

- Docs: [docs.vllm.ai/en/latest](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) Yes! Docs are useful!
- Issue tracker is a good source of information [vllm-project/vllm/issues](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues)
- Having access to an accelerator does help ðŸ™‚

- One release every three weeks
- 1716 (!) contributors as of today, 207 in the last release (65 new!). This is a 200+ contributor increase from just a couple months ago!

Lots of code:
